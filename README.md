# Heart Disease Detection

## Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict heart disease in individuals based on medical diagnostics. Utilizing Logistic Regression, the model is trained on a dataset containing 303 patient records, achieving an accuracy of approximately 82%. This tool aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making processes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises various health indicators like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other cardiovascular conditions. The dataset is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HemantGaikwad7/Heart-Disease-Detection/main/heart_disease_dataset.csv).

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Sex of the patient
- `cp`: Chest pain type
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- `thal`: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- `target`: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = disease; 0 = no disease)
